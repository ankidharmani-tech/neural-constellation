# Neural Constellation

An interactive 3D to-do list where each task is visualized as a star in space, inspired by how the human brain forms connections.

✨ How It Works

Each task is born as a star

Color represents the task domain (study, health, personal, etc.)

Depth (Z-axis proximity) represents urgency i.e. more urgent tasks appear closer

Tasks from the same domain connect like neural pathways

Clicking a star makes it burst, marking the task as complete
